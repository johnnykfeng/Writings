This blog was sparked by hearing my colleague complain about how many meetings he has, and that he was jealous me being a new employee with far fewer projects to focus on. He recently got a promotion to lead our team, which includes more managerial duties and less time to work on our own. This is the typical career progression in big companies, as one gains experience and seniority, they often get promoted to manage others. This means less time to actually doing the technical work. 

Most people would be happy to get promoted, as it's accompanied by higher pay and increased percieved status within a company. But I've heard some hate it, especially the people who enjoyed the technical work they did in the beginning. 

## Don't be a manager

I have a strong belief that highly productive technical workers should not be promoted to managers, and should not be given less unimportant responsibilies/tasks that distract them from their main project. From my readings on flow-state [1], Deep Work [2], and Hyperfocus [3], working on multiple projects at a shallow level is far worse than focussing on a few projects. When I say few, for me it means 1-2 very technically challenging projects. To illustrate why, let's start by looking at the graph results vs time graph snipped from the book Atomic Habits.

## Progress Is Never Linear

Most people believe progress is linear, such that a fixed unit of time input yields a fixed unit of results. However, the beginning of any difficult task or project goes very slowly. That is because there is a requisite period of learning and familiarization process. Once everything is downloaded into our working memory, one will notice that we naturally form more ideas/solutions for the problem at a faster rate, since less mental energy is used for learning. The later part of the productivity curve is what I call the flow state.

The key is that there needs to be sufficient time invested to reach the steep productivity curve. However, when we context switch often by working on multiple projects simultaneously, we stay in the shallow productivity region, since every task switch demands time to load information and context into one's working memory. Therefore, for the same period of time, one achieves less cumulative progress on multiple projects compared to the progress of focusing on one project.

## How to Apply This in Practice?

If you are a manager and have no choice otherwise, then there's not much I can say. Being an effective manager is a totally different skill, which I might write about in the future. For those who are in technical roles and enjoy it, avoid being a manager. More specifically, try to have fewer projects on your plate, especially if your project is complex and technically difficult. Protect your time and cherish the flow state.
