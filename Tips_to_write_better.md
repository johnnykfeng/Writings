# Tips for Writing that I can use
1. Have one sentence at the top of the page, and that is your north star. Headlines not outlines. Begin with the end in mind.
2. Forget everything you learned in school e.g. make an outline, meeting a word limit, using word fillers or fancy words. Short and sweet is better.
3. Write like you talk.
4. The first two sentences should make the audience want to no more. Start with the headline or conclusion in the beginning. 
5. Writing for the internet is completely different than writing for academics or jobs.
6. Great writing is great editing. The first draft doesn't really matter. Bang out the first draft as quickly as possible, like just brain dump everything. Then take some time away from the screen, and naturally you'll think of improvements to the draft. Draft recklessly, edit carefully.
