# How DIY-mentality makes me more effective as an applied scientist

I have a very unconventional approach to work. But I beleve my unconventional approach makes me far more productive and effective than the average person.  Just to give some context, I work as an applied scientist at a semiconductor manufacturing company in Canada. So right off the bat, it's a very unusual job position that very few people can relate to. WTF does an applied scientist even do?

In short, I build instruments and jigs to perform highly precise measurements of our product. These measurements are meant to give insight into our product in many ways, for scientific knowledge acquisition, and also characterizing the performance of our products. On top of the building aspect, I'm an actual scientist (more specifically I'm a physicist). I read scientific journal articles and absorb the latest theories and scientific studies relevant to my work. I myself don't publish since the stuff I work on is top-secret. But I read the published stuff and laugh at how wrong they are. 

Just to be clear, I am an applied "laboratory" scientist. Which is different from a applied scientist at a software company, that writes code and performs experiments on their unsuspecting customers (how else do you think social media algorithms get so powerfully addivtive). 

There is no course in university that teaches you how to do my job. I was selected for this job because of my unique experience as a PhD student in the experimental physics program. In fact, not many PhD students in any science program went through what I did. Most of the time, a science research lab buys the instrument from the commercial vendor, our has it hand-down to them from previous generations or PhD work, or they sit in front of a computer and analyze data coming from the a big expensive instrument, like the Large Hadron Collider for example. I, on the hand, had to build almost everything myself. 

The drawback of building things yourself is that you have to do more, and it's f***ing harder. The good thing is that you learn more, and have more control over the apparatus. Building an instrument for scientific purposes is vastly different than building a consumer device. You care less about the "user-friendliness" of device and more about technical precision of the device. In fact, most of the time, it is not user-friendly at all. It is highly customized to the mind of the scientist, and is built to do exactly what he/she wants so long as it obeys the non-negotiable laws of physics. Also note that limitations in time and resources is a major factor. 

There's an inspiring story of a Nobel Prize winner in Physics for the invention of the blue LED []. <his name>, the primary scientist in the group who won this award, was actually not a traditionally credentialed scientist, i.e. he didn't have a PhD. He was considered a lowly technician that worked on experiments in his own lab. The superpower he had was that he did all modifications to the instrument that ultimately led to the important scientific breakthrough. His lab was mostly a machine shop. This skill was more valuable thatn the number of publications he had, or whatever prestigous university he came from. You know those energy efficient LED light bulbs you see everywhere now, you can thank him for that. 

So what is my unconventional approach? Basically I do almost everything myself. I'm the mechanical engineer, software engineer, data scientist, product manager, all wrapped into one, in addition to having PhD level scientific knowledge about my instrument and what I'm trying to accomplish. Of course, I'm not an actual certified professional engineer in any of those fields. But I do know enough to build my own things. But why not just work with a team of certified experts in each area?

Just to clarify, I actually enjoy working with other people in different areas of expertise. In my work, I often consult others for helpful advice on things that are beyond my expertise. I am very grateful when a helpful engineer who knows more than me shares his knowledge. The downside is that it's time-consuming to coordinate with others and manage them. Also, they often do not have the domain knowledge that I have, thus it's hard for them to understand what the project is for? 

The other part is motivation. It is scary to take full ownership of all aspects of a project. If I ask someone else to work on one component of the project, their job ends as soon as the task I requested is complete. They have no stake in seeing the project succeed, so long as they meet the requirements I ask of them. Rarely will they go the extra mile in making it even better, or be willing to improve their design/work after it's done. For effective collaboration, they need skin-in-the-game.

The last bit is more personal. A part of me enjoys learning new skills to make any project succeed. A learnt skill never goes away, it stays with me for life. Once you know how use a table saw and drill/driver, you see wood differently, and in turn, you look at houses with a differently.

However, hubris is important. I can't be so arrogant in thinking that I can do everything myself, there is a fine balance. Sometimes it's worth it to pay for a plumber to fix my leaky closet, rather than watch hours of Youtube and buying all the plumbing tools myself. I will most likely make mistakes and do some damage to my house, when all that could be avoided by just hiring a professional. The weird twist in me is that I still want to learn how the job is done, so while the plumber is fixing the problem, I'll pick his brain and figure out what exactly he's doing. I can't help it, I'm wired this way.

DIY means "Do-It-Yourself". It typically refers to a movement, or any hobbiest
activity where your build, modify or repair things without the aid of certified
experts. Lazy people don't DIY. Curious people who are willing to learn are
natural DIYers.
